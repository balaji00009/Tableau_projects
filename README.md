The Story of Insurance claim analysis report

- Story Board 1: The Total claim Contribution of Female is tend to be Comparatively Higher than the male in terms of Both Income and Claim amount Wise.. In the Occupation Wise Income table it states that the Occupation Doctor, Manager, Lawyer Income Contributed 60% of Total Income all occupations out of three comparatively the Female contribution is High. In the Occupation wise claim the top three claimers were Blue collar, Student, Professional and also clerical they contributed the most claims out there Female contribution is High. Although the Income of Doctor, Manager, Lawver is High they tend to claim in lower rates.
- Story Board 2: This Dashboard contains Total Contribution of Car type Claimers with all their Income, its avg blue book value and their avg respective claim amount. Out of this the highest total contribution goes to SUV type car model then minivan, Sports car, Pick up, van and Panel Truck. The thing in the Avg Income Vs Car type Pareto contains that Panel Truck driver is the one who holds highest avg salary than others, followed by Van, Minivan which is represented in the graph the Top rank is assigned for Panel Truck in which the average claim amount is higher than Others, 2nd rank goes to the sports car, 3rd goes for van type followed.
- Story Board 3: This Dash Board tells that the Claim Status of all customers Gender Wise. The Customer or Claimer who claimed only old is 3770 in count out of that 559 claimed at least single time and 3211 people claimed more than one time. In the new claim there is only multiple claimed which is around 3770 .The interesting thing is the customer who contributed in the single claim in the last 5 year claim status is the customer who contributed the in the new claim which becomes only Multiple claims that 559 customers. Customers who contributed in the old claim and new claim were 378 in a single claim and 3392 in Multiple.
- Story Board 4: This Story of the Dash Board contains Car type vs Claim amount (old) and Claim amount (new). This tells claims status of car type and its Overall claim amount both old and new. The SUV is the car type which has the multiple claims, second highest is the minivan. The thing is this dash board is made for gather predictive insights using the last 5 year old claim people to the new Claim Status Prediction. The SUV car type holds 91.5 lakhs of Total claim in the last 5 year but in the new claim contribution it holds only around 37lakhs which is pretty comparatively the amount is less. It says in the future prediction the claim count may increases to match like old claim amount. Like wise this is followed for all the car types. Let us assume this data may be two year claim data.
- Story Board 5: This part contains old claim vs New Claim comparison view, yes the claim rate of New claim is comparatively less compared to old claim. So, as of this data provided this is current comparison, May be in the upcoming years the trend may reach like old 5 year target, because all most every car type in the data set will reach because for the past 5 year claim amount is high, the claim count will be increased in tup coming years. The SUV is the most claimed car type, followed by minivan, Pickup. These are the top 3 most claimed car type. But in the case when the car is used for commercial then the pickup comes into play may be it is used the most and also it falls into most accidents to claims, then minivan and SUV both are equal in their registration but in terms of claim the SUV is higher than the Minivan, then the panel truck. If the claim is arrived for panel truck means the average claim amount will be higher than the all the cat type. When it comes to Private SUV had the most number of claims in the data set, then minivan, sports car, Pickup, Van. The thing is the panel Truck it is not used for private purposes, it is only used for Commercial purposes. The trend will Definity go up the total number of unclaimed people is still there may be some new customers will also get into claim, the accidents are uncertain, can't be exactly predictable. There were around 3877 unclaimed customers were there. They may turn into new claim customers.
- Story Board 6:Detailed View of claim status for insights. So, the number of No Claim is Higher is higher than the Multiple or Single Claim. So the company may end up in loss when the number of No claim increases.

# Story:
Boston Condo Real Estate Agency

- Story Board 1: In Boston the total Sales is High in M Area and the Top 4 Area Including M which is HS,E,RA were contributing around 70% of Total Sales. But the Average Sales Top most area goes to E, Followed by HS,AG,W,RA. So, these are the Top 5 Area Which is Contributing the Total sales and its Average.
- Story Board 2: Why the average sale of Area E is Higher than the Area M ??. Yes, because the Area M contains Avg. Sales over the range of 40K --- 260K and its Outliers were like only one customer. And in the Area E doesn't hold as many customers like Area M, also it's sales doesn't range like M, it holds 50K --- 250K , but also 350K --- 600K there are few customers, 850K one customers. So, this makes Outliers, the distribution is not normal though. Considering all this the Area M is Considered by more customers and may be because their budget lies in that range or It may also doesn't lie in the area of Residential let Drill Down Further in the Upcoming Stories.
- Story Board 3: Yes it is because the area E only contributes for Commercial purposes only not even a single Residential this area doesn't sold for. By Comparing all other areas with RC Category, the Top 3 Residential Areas are M,HS,RA and similarly the Top 3 Commercial Purpose Areas are M,HS,E. Let's Drill down into the deep. In the Data Interpretation table the Interior Sq.ft of M is almost as similar to its own commercial purposes so, people are most likely to buy this area even its avg First Price is on Higher Side. Secondly the HS area got less Sq.ft for its residence, but high for its Commercial purposes its Avg. First Price was also like that only for its commercial it cost about 3M dollar's. So, the area E is considered only for Commercial that too its average First Price is Higher than all the other.
Story Board 3:Let us drill down by avg sale duration between Areas with respect to number of rooms. The Area M is top most priority in all categories which has total of 107 rooms its avg sale duration is also good. This is because it this area lies in the middle of Boston Town. The area HS is Having Second Highest Condo having 86 number of Rooms in it but its sale duration is Higher than the Area M. So this is because these two area are the one which is utilized for both Residential and Commercial Purposes. Regardless the area RA is the third Highest in terms of overall rooms but when it comes to Commercial purposes the Area E comes into play. Let me drill down all the types by showing in the next part of the story which has the whole Boston map which will be good for better analytics.
- Story Board 4:No of Housing units in the Area M is Higher than all the other Areas. Least Highest is the area FP & C. so, this area doesn't holds as many number of Units. Why specifically I'm targeting the least one?.
- Story Board 5: Boston Condo Area Map With Respect to Zip Codes. Area M is Covering the most Condos because it lies in the middle. The Area Hs is the one which lies exactly in the Boston City with High Condos. The area NW, K & PS were lying outside the Boston. The area E, FP lies near to Seashore and it makes easier for Transportation. The area C and W may be considered as the area for Schooling because there were so many Universities lies in its range. The Area AG is Considered as the area near to the city Brookline and Roxbury.
- Story Board 6: This is the Overall analysis, trends, Forecast over the years. In the overall trends over the years. So, the data is only having till the year up to 1994 April, the trend is slightly up towards, where the commercials market of House getting Higher than the Residential. Category wise Forecasting in the year 1995 the commercial market alone itself will be 19M $ and the Residential will be around 17.8M$.The trend its self says the commercial market is getting higher peak than the residential.
- Summary:
1.The top 5 Sales over Areas were M, HS, E, RA,AH.
2.The Avg. sales over area makes different rankings the first goes for E, then HS, AG,W,RA.
3.These Four areas M, HS, E, RA contributes over 70% of total sales.

By analyzing the area M Housing price ranges from 40K - 260K but for Area E this ranges from 50K - 600K

4.Then by drilling down in terms of RC Category the Area M was having Houses for both residential and some commercial purposes. But the area E was only for Commercial purpose. So that's why it's avg price for house range is Higher than all the other areas.

5.The Top 3 Residential Areas goes for M ,HS, RA, similarly the Top 3 Commercial Areas goes for M, HS, E.

PEOPLE SHOWING INTEREST TO PURCHASE THE ABOVE 3 AREAS EVEN THOUGH ITS FIRST VALUE QUOTE IS HIGH.

6. The sale duration doesn't have much effect for those Top 3 areas. But, the thing to notice was for area AG , RS, PS IS VERY LESS COMPARED TO ALL OTHER ON THE TOP.

- AG-Residence
- RS-Residence
- PS-Commercial
- FP-Residence
- C-Residence

7.So, the contribution of AG, RS, PS also add FP & C areas is very less because it is having less number of Housing units in these areas,

8.Let us to be clear the top areas M, HS, RA they are making their good in sales so let it be as it is. IT IS SUGGESTED TO INCREASE THE PRICE RANGE LITTLE IN THESE AREAS.PEOPLE SHOWING HIGH INTEREST IN THESE AREAS IT WILL RESULT IN PROFIT ONLY.

9.Looking at the map the area C goes only for Residential purposes only because there was High number of universities lies within its range like Cambridge.

10.FP and RS area they both located near to seaport and Airport. I would suggest these areas for residential purposes like turning Housing condos to Hotels which will be a good move to advertise will result in High sales over these areas,

11.AG area is near to Brookline town but it lies in the middle of all the areas with respect to our agency which is near to area M and C also near to Brookline town making compromises to the customers that this AG area will be high demand in future it was the middle of all the surroundings in the Boston will be a good move to make more sales,

12,PS area is last which is completely outer to the Boston which is near to Quincy those customers who want to live outside the city without any disturbances this area PS will be a good choice,

OUT OF ALL THE ABOVE 5 AREAS THE TOTAL UNIT IN COUNT IS VERY LESS TRY TO COVER MORE AREAS WITH HOUSES ALSO WITH LITTLE HIGHER IN COMMERCIAL PURPOSES TOO.

BECAUSE THE SALES TRENDS OVER THE YEARS TELLS THE COMMERCIAL CONDOS WILL OVERTAKE THE RESIDENTIAL.

So, suggesting to invest in COMMERCIAL CONDOS LITTLE MORE THAN RESIDENTAIL WOULD BE A GREAT MOVE BECAUSE IN FORECAST YOU HAVE THE POINT.......
