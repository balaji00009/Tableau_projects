- Story Board 1: The Total claim Contribution of Female is tend to be Comparatively Higher than the male in terms of Both Income and Claim amount Wise.. In the Occupation Wise Income table it states that the Occupation Doctor, Manager, Lawyer Income Contributed 60% of Total Income all occupations out of three comparatively the Female contribution is High. In the Occupation wise claim the top three claimers were Blue collar, Student, Professional and also clerical they contributed the most claims out there Female contribution is High. Although the Income of Doctor, Manager, Lawver is High they tend to claim in lower rates.
- Story Board 2: This Dashboard contains Total Contribution of Car type Claimers with all their Income, its avg blue book value and their avg respective claim amount. Out of this the highest total contribution goes to SUV type car model then minivan, Sports car, Pick up, van and Panel Truck. The thing in the Avg Income Vs Car type Pareto contains that Panel Truck driver is the one who holds highest avg salary than others, followed by Van, Minivan which is represented in the graph the Top rank is assigned for Panel Truck in which the average claim amount is higher than Others, 2nd rank goes to the sports car, 3rd goes for van type followed.
- Story Board 3: This Dash Board tells that the Claim Status of all customers Gender Wise. The Customer or Claimer who claimed only old is 3770 in count out of that 559 claimed at least single time and 3211 people claimed more than one time. In the new claim there is only multiple claimed which is around 3770 .The interesting thing is the customer who contributed in the single claim in the last 5 year claim status is the customer who contributed the in the new claim which becomes only Multiple claims that 559 customers. Customers who contributed in the old claim and new claim were 378 in a single claim and 3392 in Multiple.
- Story Board 4: This Story of the Dash Board contains Car type vs Claim amount (old) and Claim amount (new). This tells claims status of car type and its Overall claim amount both old and new. The SUV is the car type which has the multiple claims, second highest is the minivan. The thing is this dash board is made for gather predictive insights using the last 5 year old claim people to the new Claim Status Prediction. The SUV car type holds 91.5 lakhs of Total claim in the last 5 year but in the new claim contribution it holds only around 37lakhs which is pretty comparatively the amount is less. It says in the future prediction the claim count may increases to match like old claim amount. Like wise this is followed for all the car types. Let us assume this data may be two year claim data.
- Story Board 5: This part contains old claim vs New Claim comparison view, yes the claim rate of New claim is comparatively less compared to old claim. So, as of this data provided this is current comparison, May be in the upcoming years the trend may reach like old 5 year target, because all most every car type in the data set will reach because for the past 5 year claim amount is high, the claim count will be increased in tup coming years. The SUV is the most claimed car type, followed by minivan, Pickup. These are the top 3 most claimed car type. But in the case when the car is used for commercial then the pickup comes into play may be it is used the most and also it falls into most accidents to claims, then minivan and SUV both are equal in their registration but in terms of claim the SUV is higher than the Minivan, then the panel truck. If the claim is arrived for panel truck means the average claim amount will be higher than the all the cat type. When it comes to Private SUV had the most number of claims in the data set, then minivan, sports car, Pickup, Van. The thing is the panel Truck it is not used for private purposes, it is only used for Commercial purposes. The trend will Definity go up the total number of unclaimed people is still there may be some new customers will also get into claim, the accidents are uncertain, can't be exactly predictable. There were around 3877 unclaimed customers were there. They may turn into new claim customers.
- Story Board 6:Detailed View of claim status for insights. So, the number of No Claim is Higher is higher than the Multiple or Single Claim. So the company may end up in loss when the number of No claim increases.
